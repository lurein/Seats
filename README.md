# Seats

An award-winning accessibility project which used an arduino-based sensor array and an iPhone application to direct blind students to open Seats in college dining halls.

Founding members: Juan Suarez, Lurein Perera, Yinzhe Ma, Estevan Feliz and Jay Agrawal.

Current Stage: Working Prototype, R&D to increase cost efficiency, Open to funding.


## Arduino Script Details
**Author:** Estevan Feliz<br/>**Language:** C++<br/>**Description:** This is the script that ran on the Arduino board. It monitors all of the hardware/sensors & then pushes that data through serial communication to the server running a local Python script. After the Python script receives the data, it parses the information & pushes it to our web server. We were using PHP for the primary backend language & all the data was stored as JSON objects. Refer to the PHP files for further information on how that worked.

## iOS App Details
**Author:** Juan Suarez <br/> **Language:** Swift<br/>**Description:** This application read data from our API and displayed this on an iPhone screen, consistent with Apple's accessibility guidelines making it easy to navigate with audio guidance. The app is compressed within the PerkinsHacks.zip file.


## BrailleTouch App Details
**Author:** Lurein Perera <br/> **Language:** Swift<br/>**Description:** This application was supplemental to the Seats dining hall solution, utilizing OCR to translate dining hall menus directly into braille.

## API Pusher Script
**Author:** Yinzhe Ma <br/> **Language:** Python<br/>**Description:** This read data from the Arduino and pushed it to our PHP API Server

## PHP Script
**Authors:** Jay Agrawal, Estevan Feliz <br/> **Language:** PHP<br/>**Description:** This was our backend for the project, all arduino sensors would push their data to this, and the various applications would read from this API
